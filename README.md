# Udacity Full Stack Interview Practice Questions
This repository will hold my answers to the practice interview questions that are part of Udacity's Full Stack Web Development Nanodegree. Text answers will be located in the readme, while code answers will be stored as separate files.

## Questions
Q. **What is the most influential book or blog post youâ€™ve read regarding web development?**
A.

Q. **Tell me about a web application you have built. Why did you choose to build it? What did you learn? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?**
A.

Q. **Write a function in Python that takes a list of strings and returns a single string that is an HTML unordered list of those strings. You should include a brief explanation of your code. Then, what would you have to consider if the original list was provided by user input?**
A. The code for this answer can be found in the `question_2.py` file. The file contains a Python function which accepts a list as an argument. After an initial result string is set with the string variable `list`, the list `l` if iterated through, and each item in the list is added to the `list` string variable wrapped in `<li></li>` tags. After the loop has completed, the closing `</ul>` is added to the string, and the entire string is return. A simple test case is provided contain a list of fruit names as strings. If you wanted to use a similar function to accept user input, you would need to add an input box for a user to enter information, and then add another function that would capture that information, and pass it to the `return_list` function.
